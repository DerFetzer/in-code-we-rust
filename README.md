# `in-code-we-rust`
This repo contains small exercises for learning programming in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It assumes that Rust is already installed on your machine and you have a basic understanding of programming concepts.

## Content
Each exercise is an independent crate in the [crates](crates) folder that contains a description of what it is about and some links to appropriate learning resources.
It is advised to solve them in ascending order.

Most of the crates contain a folder `examples` that contains proposed solutions to the problems.

## How To
1. Look at the README in the `exercise-XX` folder to get an idea what to do.
2. Browse the existing source code and try to understand it.
3. Use the provided resources to solve the exercise.
4. Run `cargo run`/`cargo test` and verify your solution.
5. To run a proposed solution use `cargo run --example solutionXX`

**Note:** Making some crates compile could be part of the exercise!
