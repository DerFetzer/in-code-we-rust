# `exercise-09`
Goal of this exercise is to add REST-Api endpoints for report management. 
Check out branch `02-report-api` of the [result-guide](https://github.com/DerFetzer/result-guide) repo.

## ToDo
1. Have a look at the changes between branches `01-intro` and `02-report-api` and understand what they do.
2. What is the library [axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/) used for?
3. Run the program and use your favorite tool to do some api requests.
4. Implement some more API endpoints:
  - Add teststep for report
  - Get teststep
  - Get all teststeps for a report
  - Delete report and its teststeps
