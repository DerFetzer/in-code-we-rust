# `exercise-02`
Goal of this exercise is making all binaries compile.

## ToDo
1. Have a look at the `Cake` struct in [lib.rs](src/lib.rs) and try to understand what it does. Ignore the `PhantomData` parts for now.
2. Try to run each binary in the [bin](src/bin) folder with `cargo run --bin b0x`.
3. Have a look at the generated compiler errors and try to fix them.
4. Hints to the solutions can be found in the next binary.
